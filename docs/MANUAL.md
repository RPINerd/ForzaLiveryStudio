# Forza Livery Studio — User Manual

A practical guide to the editor's tools, keyboard shortcuts, panels, and
recommended working pipelines. For build/developer notes see
[DEV.md](DEV.md).

> All keyboard shortcuts below are the defaults. Every shortcut is rebindable
> from **Window → Settings…** (`Ctrl+K`).

| Settings… | `Ctrl+K` |

## Tools & Behaviours

- **Select (`S`)** — primary editing tool. Click a shape or group to select it,
  drag to move. Works together with the layer tree selection.
- **Move (`V`)** — dedicated move tool. Enable **Options → Move Tool
  Auto-Select** to select the layer group you click and to clear the selection
  when clicking empty canvas.
- **Marquee (`F`)** — drag a rectangle to select every layer it touches.
- **Transform (`T`)** — drag edge/corner handles to scale, side handles to skew.
  For a group or multi-shape selection the values transform the selection's
  bounding box about its centre (each child keeps its relative position) rather
  than editing each shape in place.
- **Rotate (`R`)** — rotate the selection about its centre. Enable **Options →
  Transform Relative Mode** if you want the transform/rotate handles to follow
  the selected shape or group rotation.
- **Place Text** (toolbar) — build a line of text from the vector font glyphs.
  Clicking the toolbar button opens a dialog to pick a **font** (Arial, Magneto,
  Freestyle, Pristina, EnglishMT, BrushMT, Impact, Playbill, TimesNewRoman,
  Elephant, CenturyGothic) and type the **text**. On confirm the glyph shapes are
  laid out proportionally in a line at the current view centre and grouped into a
  new group named after the text. Text is case-sensitive (upper and lower letters
  use different glyphs). Supported characters are `A–Z a–z 1–9 0 ! ? @ &` and the
  lowercase symbols `$ £ ¥ € ( ) ¢ * # + % ; : ,`; a space inserts a gap and any
  other character is skipped (reported afterwards).
- **Numeric property drag** — in the Properties dock, drag a numeric field's
  label left/right (or up/down) to scrub its value live.
- **Import** (**File → Import…**) — one context-aware importer. Pick a `C_group`
  or `C_livery` file (or drop a file/folder in); the editor detects which it is
  and loads it as an editable group project or a read-only livery viewer.
- **Export** (**File → Export…**) — one exporter. A dialog asks for the format
  (**Flat** or **Nested**) and then a destination folder.
- **Project files** — projects save to a `.3so` container: the editor project
  JSON wrapped in a gzip stream. Legacy plain-JSON (`.json`) projects still open.
- **Guide layers** — import a raster image as an editor-only reference layer
  (**File → Import Guide Layer…**, toolbar **Add Guide Layer**, or drag an image
  from Explorer). Guide layers are stored inside the project file and ignored by
  game export.
- **Drag & drop** — drop a project (`.3so`/`.json`), a `C_group`/`C_livery`
  file/folder, or an image file from Explorer straight onto the window.
- **Flash Selected Layers (`\`)** — briefly flash the current selection on the
  canvas to locate it.

## Panels

- **Canvas** — the OpenGL editing surface; pan and zoom to navigate.
- **Layers** — the layer/group/guide tree with thumbnails and visibility / mask
  / lock badges. Reorder siblings by internal drag/drop; group, ungroup, delete,
  copy/cut/paste, duplicate, and stamp from here or the Edit menu.
- **Properties** — edit name, shape ID, position, scale, rotation, skew,
  opacity, colour, visibility, mask, and lock for the current selection.
  Enable **Options → Show Property Debug** for extra diagnostics.
- **Shapes** — browse and insert vector shapes.
  - Shapes are labelled `Name (ID)` (e.g. `Square (101)`); names come from
    `assets/vector/shape_names.json` and are reparsed on each launch.
  - The search box matches by **ID** or **name** and activates at **3
    characters**; shorter input shows a hint. Search spans every category (and
    matching custom groups).
  - Star a shape to add it to **Favourites**. Use **Add current selection** to
    save the current selection as a reusable **Custom** group.
- **Buffer** — shows the current clipboard contents.
- **Header** — edit header metadata written into exported projects.

## Recommended Pipelines

### Edit an existing game vinyl

1. **File → Import…** and pick the `C_group` file (or folder) to load a game
   group as an editable project.
2. Edit with the canvas tools and the Layers / Properties docks.
3. **File → Save Project…** (`Ctrl+S`) to keep an editable `.3so` copy.
4. **File → Export…**, choose **Flat**, to write a game-compatible folder.

### Build a new design from shapes

1. **File → New Project** (`Ctrl+N`).
2. Open the **Shapes** dock, search by name or ID, and insert shapes.
3. Arrange with Select/Move, size with Transform, orient with Rotate.
4. Select related shapes and **Group** (`Ctrl+G`); reuse a finished cluster by
   selecting it and choosing **Add current selection** in the Shapes dock.
5. Export when done.

### Trace over a reference image

1. Import the reference via **Import Guide Layer…** (or drag it in).
2. Build your shapes on top; the guide layer never exports to the game.
3. Hide or delete the guide layer before finishing (it is safely ignored by
   export regardless).

### Flat vs. Nested export

- **Flat** is the stable, game-proven export path — use it by default.
- **Nested** preserves group structure, nesting, and masks. It is validated
  in-game for sibling groups, multi-level nesting, and masks, but is not
  byte-identical to the game's own encoding. Prefer it when group semantics must
  survive the round-trip.
